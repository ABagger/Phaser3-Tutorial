# Super-Rocket-Patrol

This game is a project I have undertaken as a way to 
learn the Phaser3 engine. It is based on the 1978 game 
Rocket Patrol for the APF-MP1000 (rolls right off the 
tongue, doesn't it?)

As of 9/21 this project is still in progress

Features yet to be added:
- Start menu (top priority)
- SFX & Music (close second)
- Particles (only if it still needs polish)
- Multiplayer (only if I'm very bored)
