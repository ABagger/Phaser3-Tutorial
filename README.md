# Super-Rocket-Patrol

This game is a project I have undertaken as a way to 
learn the Phaser3 engine. It is based on the 1978 game 
Rocket Patrol for the APF-MP1000 (rolls right off the 
tongue, doesn't it?) This is the tutorial which provided
the framework that I built additional features on top of:

I have aimed to improve the base game, both graphically 
and mechanically; Notably I've added more complex ship 
movement, a visible countdown timer, and about a dozen
tweaks to things like rocket and scroll speed.

As of 10/19 this project is still in progress
